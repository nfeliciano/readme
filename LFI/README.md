**What**: Let's Face It! Scrapbook is an iPad app being developed at the Centre of Autism Research, Technology, and Education    ([Site](http://web.uvic.ca/~carte/) | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CARTEUVIC/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel)) at the University of Victoria. The aim of the app is to enhance the socio-emotional skills of children with ASD, taking inspiration from the original Let's Face It! program ([Link](http://web.uvic.ca/~letsface/letsfaceit/)) and extending it by making the content children play with more personal.    
**Who**: I'm part of the tech team at CARTE, working with a team of student developers (that's changed a lot over the years!). I've led the team working on this project since 2015.  
**When**: The app has gone through a number of iterations and beta tests since 2012, we released in February 2016.   
**Where**: Screenshots in this repository. It is on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/lets-face-it!-scrapbook/id1030111507?ls=1&mt=8) and you'll find many video tutorials of earlier versions on [the LFI website](http://web.uvic.ca/~carte/lfiscrapbook.html). The project is sitting in a private repository.

**My Role**: From the beginning, I was involved in most aspects of the app, including coding up the main user interface (which has changed many times since the program's inception), working on the content creation module (i.e. working with the iOS camera), working with Core Data for the content models, and working with Instruments to eliminate memory leaks and issues introduced. One of my large early tasks was to refactor the code so that it would be more modular and easier to understand, separating the core functions of the app and more closely following the MVC model. More recently, I've worked as a lead of sorts to delegate tasks and help volunteers and others in the group to learn the development process.    
**What I learned**: More about the app development process, including technologies that I had not worked with before, such as Core Data and SpriteKit. I've also learned a lot about leading a team and the fun and challenges that come with it, particularly that which comes with requirements that change regularly from testing with the target population.
