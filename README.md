Here be a list of stuff I've worked on with relevant links. Also miscellaneous stuff.    

**LFI 2.0** - Proud of this project, was a team lead for it for a bit of time. Check it [here](/LFI), with the app [on the iPad App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/lets-face-it!-scrapbook/id1030111507?mt=8), and some video demos (of not the final version) [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAhUx4QlsJ4)    
**Linksupp** - Class project, web app with some details listed [here](/Linksupp). The app is no longer deployed for the meanwhile, but here's a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ol6h0DApqQ).    
**JPLC** - iPad game [here](/JPLC) that's no longer on the App Store (due to cost of a developer account that I didn't need). Developed and released in around 3 months, and was well polished to boot! Now on [GitHub](https://github.com/nfeliciano/jplc)   
**Comic Tycoon** - Part of my work with Insatiable Genius, [here](/ComicTycoon) and on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/comic-tycoon-hd/id609065885?mt=8)  along with [PencilFX](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pencilfx/id543704201?mt=8).
